## About

Hi devs, this project was developed with the guys from @Rocketseat 🚀 during an event that they call NLW (Next Level Week) where we develop a fullstack application during a week. 

And this time was a Habit Tracker app. The user can monitorate his activities performed and not performed and create new ones. 

My app have an inspiration on Reservatório de Dopamina (RD), that is a motivating environment created by Eslen Delanogare, a renowned psychologist in Brazil. Have a routine with good habits and you gonna see how the things will start to become good. 🎈
